# Phase 1: Cart API Discovery & Planning ✅

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **Audit Cart functionality** - Identified 8 Cart-related commits
- [x] **Map Cart integration points** - Found root-level API exposure pattern
- [x] **Plan conflict resolution** - Documented constructor & test migrations needed
- [x] **Document findings** - Created CART_INTEGRATION_DISCOVERY.md

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Cart Commits**: 8 commits total, with `119ad0b` as the primary implementation
2. **Architecture**: Cart API exposed at root level via `.Carts()` extension
3. **Files**: 9 operation classes + 4 type definitions  
4. **Integration Choice**: Keep at root initially, consider Management move later
5. **Main Risks**: Constructor patterns (High), Test framework (High)

## Ready for Phase 2? ✅

**Prerequisites met:**
- Cart commit list ready for cherry-picking
- Pattern transformation templates documented
- Integration strategy decided (root-level first)
- Conflict areas identified

**Phase 2 Start Command:**
```bash
# Create backup before starting
git checkout -b cart-integration-backup

# Begin with main Cart commit
git cherry-pick 119ad0b
```
